# WebServer
* The main aim of this project is to improve your understanding of Socket programming using Java
* This project is a simple simulation of "Pintrest" 
* You start by running the Server.java class
* And then you can run multiple clients 
* Each client can view your website
* Each client can choose to download any file from your website and the HTTP Response will be downloaded as well
* You will find a seperate directory on your local host for each client containing this client's dowloads
* In the console you will find the HTTP Response as well so if an item is not found you will find an error 404 
* If you want to use this project change the directory paths to your own 
* Here is a demo of what your website should look like when you run this project
